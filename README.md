1621ICT Web Technologies Assignment.

The focus of this assignment was to learn the foundations of web app development. This includes basic html, css and javascript. I also worked with a basic sql database and used php to make queries for items such as merchandise and tour dates.

This particular website is based off a fictional band and centered around creating a hub for all things related to the band.
